This is a Lua script so you can assign keys and buttons to the button and switches on the MCP of the FlightFactor B777 V1 (not V2)

It works with FlyWithLua so if you aren't sure about what that is, maybe do some research on it and how to use it etc before downloading this file.

All you do (i think) is to download the file and place it:
directory/of/your/xplane/resources/plugins/flywithlua/scripts 

I hope this is helpful! I haven't found much resources online about this so i hope this works for you (i did for me at least)

*this is still a prototype! please don't expect it to have every function or have everything perfected. I will continue to fix it
