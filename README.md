This is a Lua script so you can assign keys and buttons to the button and switches on the MCP of the FlightFactor B777 V1 (not V2)

It works with FlyWithLua so if you aren't sure about what that is, maybe do some research on it and how to use it etc before downloading this file.

All you do (i think) is to download the file and place it:
directory/of/your/xplane/resources/plugins/flywithlua/scripts
